A complete crowdfunding and donation plugin for WordPress with dual operation modes, advanced analytics, and a modern user experience.

== Description ==
Growfund is a complete WordPress crowdfunding and donation plugin that helps you collect funds directly from your website. It’s perfect for nonprofits, community projects, charities, content creators, and personal causes who want full control over their fundraising system.

With Growfund, you can create unlimited crowdfunding campaigns, collect direct donations, etc. Most importantly, you can manage everything right from your WordPress dashboard without paying extra platform fees.

It’s built with PHP and React.js, so it’s fast, modern, and easy to use. Growfund gives you a clean interface, simple workflows, and powerful donor management features that anyone can handle. 

You don’t need to be a tech expert or have any custom coding to manage donation campaigns or crowdfunding projects via Growfund. Its intuitive design and custom workflow make the overall campaign management smoother than ever. But under the hood, it’s strong enough for large organizations with thousands of donors.

== 🌱 What is Growfund? ==

Growfund is a WordPress fundraising plugin that lets you create a professional donation or crowdfunding website in minutes. It combines the best of both worlds:

*     **Campaign Mode** for pledge-based crowdfunding.
*     **Donation Mode** for collecting direct and anonymous donations.

Whether you’re building a charity donation portal or a project funding site, Growfund adapts easily. It’s built to give fundraisers the freedom and donors the confidence they need, while keeping the admin fully in control.

== 💡 Why Growfund Stands Out ==

Growfund is not just another donation plugin for WordPress. It’s a complete fundraising system for individuals and organizations. Here’s why this free donation plugin stands out from others:

*     **You own your data:** All donor information stays right on your site. Growfund does not collect campaign, donor, or transaction data. Everything stays on your WordPress site.
*     **Scalability:** Accept 10 donations or 10,000, the system scales with you.
*     **Fast and beautiful:** The frontend is built with React.js and optimized properly to ensure an intuitive design and faster page loading speed.
*     **Mobile-ready:** Over 60% of donations are made on phones. So, Growfund is designed by keeping responsiveness in mind.
*     **Effortless payment collection:** Use built-in native eCommerce or WooCommerce for donations and collect funds securely for your campaigns.

Now, let’s take a look at the core features of Growfund in detail.

== 🚀 Dual Fundraising Modes ==

Growfund offers two main modes so you can run the type of fundraiser that fits your needs best.

1️⃣ **Reward-based Crowdfunding Campaign Mode**

Run crowdfunding campaigns with funding goals and reward tiers. Fundraisers can set targets, post updates, and share progress with supporters.

*    Set a goal and campaign deadline
*    Accept multiple pledges
*    Offer rewards or perks
*    Individual backer dashboard
*    Track progress automatically, etc.

This is perfect for creators, entrepreneurs, or anyone running reward-based crowdfunding projects.

2️⃣ **Donation Mode**

If you’re a nonprofit or a small organization, you can use Donation Mode to collect direct contributions.

*    Simple, one-time donations
*    Intuitive donation form
*    Individual donor dashboard
*    Anonymous donations (Pro)
*    Company donations (Pro)
*    Tribute donations (Pro) — in honor or memory of someone

Both modes work beautifully with WordPress and give you full control over your fundraising system.

== 🛠️ Campaign Creation and Management ==

Creating a campaign with Growfund is simple and intuitive. The built-in campaign builder lets fundraisers:

*    Add titles, featured images, and videos to their campaigns.
*    Write detailed campaign descriptions.
*    Set campaign goal amount and deadline.
*    Choose categories and tags to categorize campaigns.
*    Add FAQs so donors or backers understand your cause. (Pro)
*    Schedule campaigns to start on a future date. (Pro)
*    Post campaign comments to keep the backers informed. (Pro)

Campaigns can be saved as drafts, submitted for approval, or published immediately (depending on admin settings). Admins can review, approve, decline, or end campaigns easily from the backend. 

== 👥 User Roles and Dashboards ==

Growfund comes with a multi-role system, so every user type has its own dashboard and tools.

*    **Administrator:** Manages the whole platform, campaigns, donations, and transactions.
*    **Fundraiser:** Creates and manages their own and assigned crowdfunding campaigns. (Pro)
*    **Donor:** Makes donations and views donation history.
*    **Backer:** Supports crowdfunding projects through pledges.

Growfund provides the appropriate access level to each user. Fundraisers only see their own campaigns, donors can track their history, and admins oversee everything from a central dashboard. This system keeps your crowdfunding platform organized, secure, and easy to manage.

== 💳 Native eCommerce with Payment Gateways ==
Growfund offers a native eCommerce solution with built-in payment gateways. Currently, it supports PayPal, Stripe, and manual payment. 

Thus, you can accept donations via all major debit and credit cards, as well as PayPal transfers, to process donations or pledges. It also supports offline donations for manual payments, such as bank transfers or checks.

However, if you prefer to use WooCommerce for donations, you can do so as well. Growfund works seamlessly with WooCommerce and its payment gateways. 

Growfund lets the admin:

*    Track every transaction
*    Accept donations via PayPal and Stripe 
*    Accept offline donations via Native eCommerce
*    Track payments from the dashboard Analytics
*    Generate annual receipts (Pro)
*    View payment summaries and histories (Pro)

== 🎁 Reward and Pledge System ==

For crowdfunding projects, Growfund includes a built-in reward system that encourages backers to contribute more. Admin or Fundraisers can create multiple reward levels with:

*    Custom pledge amounts
*    Reward descriptions
*    Estimated delivery details
*    Item quantity limits, etc.

Backers can choose a reward tier or simply pledge without selecting a reward. Users also have the functionality to make pledges without any reward. 

== 💰 Donation Features ==

You can create unlimited donation campaigns using Growfund. In the donation mode, you can:

*    Create unlimited donation campaigns
*    Intuitive donation form
*    Collect one-time donations
*    Allow anonymous donations (Pro)
*    Offer company donations (Pro)
*    Offer donors the option to tribute their donation to someone (Pro)
*    Organize donations by category or fund type (Pro)
*    Sent automated emails after every donation
*    Offer personalized donation receipts
*    Add tax information to donation receipts (Pro)

You can manage and track every donation from your own dashboard. It simplifies campaign and donor management, allowing you to focus on making a meaningful impact.

== 🏦 Fund Management System (Pro) ==

Growfund makes it easy to manage multiple funds for different causes. You can create unlimited funds and assign multiple campaigns under each fund to keep your donations organized. 

For example, if your organization runs both “Education for All” and “Clean Water Project”, you can create two separate funds. Then, assign relevant campaigns like “Build a School in Bangladesh” or “Water Wells in Africa” under each fund.

Each fund will have its own:

*    Fund overview page
*    Number of campaigns
*    List of active donors
*    Detailed fund performance reports

This feature gives admins a clearer financial overview and makes managing donation funds easier than ever.

== 👥 Fundraiser Management (Pro) ==

Growfund provides a robust fundraiser management system to keep your platform organized and efficient. Admins can create, assign, and manage multiple fundraisers, giving each one control over their campaigns while maintaining overall oversight.

With this feature, the admin can:

*    Assign fundraisers to specific campaigns or funds 
*    Track fundraiser activity through detailed logs 
*    Monitor donations collected by each fundraiser
*    View performance analytics for fundraisers, etc.

== 📊 Reports and Analytics ==

Knowing how your campaigns perform is important for growth. Growfund gives you built-in fundraising analytics for clear insight. Here you can view:

*    Total raised amount
*    Campaign performance
*    Total pledged and backed amount
*    Top campaigns, donors, and fundraisers
*    Daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly reports
*    Transaction summaries, etc.

The analytics are easy to read, so even beginners can understand their fundraising results at a glance.

== 📧 Email Notifications and Communication ==

Growfund includes 40+ types of email notifications that keep users informed at every step. For example:

*    Donation receipts for donors
*    Campaign approval notices for fundraisers
*    Payment confirmation emails
*    Updates about campaign progress

You can edit each email template to match your brand’s tone and design. Users can also choose which notifications they want to receive. This ensures clear communication and builds trust among donors, fundraisers, and admins.

== 🎨 Customization and Branding ==

Every organization wants its fundraising platform to look unique, and Growfund makes that easier than ever. You can:

*    Add your brand logo to the user dashboard
*    Adjust button colors and typography (Pro)
*    Customize email appearance (Pro) 
*    Update email subject and body descriptions, etc.

All front-end templates are responsive, so your fundraising site looks great on phones, tablets, and desktops. This dashboard is built with React.js for a modern and fast interface that makes managing everything smoother.

==🔐 Security and Privacy==

Growfund is designed with security and data protection in mind. It includes:

*    Spam protection for all forms
*    Secure communication with payment gateways
*    Email verification during registration (Pro)
*    Safe handling of user and transaction data, etc.

Admins can also monitor all user activity through logs to ensure transparency across the system.

== 🧾 Admin Dashboard and Management Tools ==

The admin dashboard is the heart of Growfund. It gives site owners full control over all parts of the fundraising platform. Admins can:

*    Approve or reject campaigns
*    Manage users, roles, and permissions
*    View all transactions and payouts
*    Set global commission rates
*    Handle refunds and offline donations
*    Generate PDF receipts, etc.

It’s designed to keep everything organized and easy to manage — even for large-scale fundraising websites.

== 🌍 Translation Ready ==

Growfund is translation-ready, meaning it works with popular WordPress translation plugins like Loco Translate or WPML. You can run your fundraising website in any language and make it accessible to a global audience. All text strings are translatable, so every message, label, or button can match your preferred language.

== 💬 Communication and Community ==

Fundraising is about connecting people — and Growfund helps make that easy. Supporters can leave messages on campaigns, share them on social media, and follow updates.

Also admin can assign fundraisers to manage specific funds. Fundraisers can post campaign updates, share milestones, and thank their supporters directly through the platform. This two-way communication helps build trust and keeps the community engaged.
